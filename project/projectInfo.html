            <h1 class="center"> PROJECT GOALS</h1>

            <p class="center"> This virtual reality will develop a meditative therapy experience to reduce general anxiety and stress. 
                The player will be placed in a natural environment with mountains and water. A heavy importance will be placed on
                 sound design and visuals to fully immerse the player into a different world. While developing this project, 
                 there will be three key steps. Selecting a targeted area, learning new softwares, and developing the experience. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="center">In order to decide on a targeted area of therapy for this project, I will research the treatments and conditions
                  in which VR would be beneficial for and previous studies that have been conducted using similar treatment methods.
                   Learning new softwares is an important step to this project, many of the programs used for game development are 
                   difficult but vital to the gamming and animation industry. Throughout the summer 2020 I will become and expereinced 
                   user in many of these important softwares. With the two previous steps completed, I will be able to develop a virtual 
                   reality experience that can provide a positive experience for any player who would like to reduce general stress and anxiety.     </p>

            <h2 class="center">Inspiration</h2>
            <p class="center">For this experience I am developing an environment that includes a mountain range that surrounds 
                a small body of water. Some inspiration for this setting comes from Maroon Bell's, Colorado.
                 The player will be able to walk freely around this environment and explore. As the player explores, 
                 there will be changing sounds to suit the environment. Over Summer 2020, I captured reference images 
                 to not only help with concept design but also to use as textures for my assets, ensuring they will look 
                 as accurate as possible. While my passion for hiking and nature inspired the visuals for this project,
                  my history of studying biofeedback therapy motivated me to use my animation major to learn and create 
                  new forms of therapy treatments.    </p>
